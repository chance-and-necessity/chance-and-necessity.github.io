## Chance and Necessity
The beginnings of a homepage -- stay tuned. 
This should eventually, one day, contain:
- Some programming, split between bioinformatics and type theory, and possibly some overlaps between them (type-directed bioinformatics pipelines...imagine...)
- Some notes on mathematical modeling of biological systems
- Some notes for mathematics proper
- Some writing, and other artistic endeavors.
